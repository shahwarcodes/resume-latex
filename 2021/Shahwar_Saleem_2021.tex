% IMPORTANT: THIS TEMPLATE NEEDS TO BE COMPILED WITH XeLaTeX
%
% This template uses several fonts not included with Windows/Linux by
% default. If you get compilation errors saying a font is missing, find the line
% on which the font is used and either change it to a font included with your
% operating system or comment the line out to use the default font.

% 
% TODO:
% 1. Integrate biber/bibtex for article citation under publications.
% 2. Figure out a smoother way for the document to flow onto the next page.
% 3. Add styling information for a "Projects/Hacks" section.
% 4. Add location/address information
% 5. Merge OpenFont and MacFonts as a single sty with options.
% 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%

% CHANGELOG:
% v1.1:
% 1. Fixed several compilation bugs with \renewcommand
% 2. Got Open-source fonts (Windows/Linux support)
% 3. Added Last Updated
% 4. Move Title styling into .sty
% 5. Commented .sty file.
%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%
% Known Issues:
% 1. Overflows onto second page if any column's contents are more than the
% vertical limit
% 2. Hacky space on the first bullet point on the second column.

\runsubsection{Borealis AI}
\descript{| Machine Learning Software Engineer }
\location{July 2019 - Present | Waterloo, ON}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}

\item Designed/Implemented a scalable solution for accessing structured data from different storages like NAS, S3 etc. Data Access Platform enables researchers to efficiently access random data from O(100TB) datasets. The solution capitalizes on the typical Database idea of indexing, the difference is that this indexing is done by traversing File System on millions of files of the dataset.

\item Designed/Implemented robust Jenkins + Openshift based scalable CI/CD pipeline for pip packages. This pipeline automated the package delivery to users through artifactory within Borealis AI. Integrated a versioning strategy with pipeline to streamline release process. Release process was cut down to automated minutes from hours of human intervention.

\item Responsible for vision and roadmap of a data access platform. On boarded 5-6 projects to use Data Access Platform. Data Accessing efforts of all these projects were brought down to a few commands and minutes in processing from hours and days of processing and lots of lines of code to write until researchers get to see the data.

\runsubsection{Pronavigator.io}
\descript{| Software Engineer (Machine Learning) }
\location{August 2018 - June 2019 | Kitchener, ON}
\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}

\item Designed/Implemented Neural Network based NLU Engine for Pronav. This design was proposed after analysing poor performance of SVM based NLU Engine of Pronav. New NLU Engine saved thousands of dollars of server costs per month and responded to requests 100x faster than the SVM based NLU Engine. 

\item Designed/Implemented an accuracy evaluation tool based on Confusion Matrix technique tailored to text classification needs of Pronav NLU Engine. This evaluation platform highlighted major issues with Data Cleaning process. 

\item Re-defined Data Cleaning processes in the light of above insights from accuracy evaluation tool. Documented the data cleaning process and mentored several Data Analysts to look at the data from NLU Engine perspective before labelling. This provided a sight into correlations between different kinds of user messages. An accuracy performance increase of 10 to 15\% was evident because owing to more context driven confusion matrix data was labelled accordingly.

%\location{Sept 2016 - Aug 2017 | San Francisco Bay Area (Remote)}
%\begin{tightemize}
%\item  Design, experiment and maintenance of price prediction models based on RFs and NNs. Hands on experience with training neural networks for price prediction.
%\item Architecture design of React Native app for Stowk. Also worked on GraphQL based API backend.\end{tightemize}

\runsubsection{Mentor Graphics Corporation}
\descript{| Software Engineer}
\location{Oct 2013 - May 2016 | Lahore, Pakistan}
\begin{tightemize}

\item Improved visualization of processes on a multi-core architecture in RTOS by implementing a feature called Kernel Awareness. Kernel Awareness connected the core information of a process to pre-defined UI. Through this UI of Kernel Awareness, developers could clearly see state, memory utilization, affinity etc of each process which is critical in an RTOS.

\item Experienced developing different device drivers for Nucleus RTOS. (I2C, SPI, LCD, CAN etc drivers for ARM \& PPC Architectures)
